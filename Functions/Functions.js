//Functions in JS

/*
Functions are blocks of code that can be named and reused.

Here’s how to declare a function:
EXAMPLE :- 

function addTwoNumbers(x, y) {
       return x + y;
}

There’s a lot going on in the example above, so let’s look at each part individually.

--> function is the keyword that starts declaring a function.
--> addTwoNumbers is the function’s name, which is customizable — just like variable names.
--> (x, y) are parameters, variable names for the inputs a function will accept.
--> return is the keyword that exits the function and shares an optional value outside.
